Part 2 â€“ Functional Manual Testing
Please write three test cases (non-automated) for the endpoint above using Gherkin. Take a good look at the data in the API and come up with three test cases. You can write them in Gherkin format if you wish.

Answer:-

@test1
Scenario : Verify status code and response time
Given the user has access to the ottplatform/media API
When the user sends a GET request to the API
Then the response status code should be 200
And the response time should be less than 1000 milliseconds  

@test2    
Scenario : Verify id and segment_type in response
Given the user has access to the ottplatform/media API
When the user sends a GET request to the API
Then the response status code should be 200
And each item in the response should have an id that is not null or empty
And each item in the response should have a segment_type of "music"

@test3
Scenario : Verify primary field in response
Given the user has access to the ottplatform/media API
When the user sends a GET request to the API
Then the response status code should be 200
And each item in the response should have a primary field that is not null or empty
